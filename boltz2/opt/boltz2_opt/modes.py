"""The mode table — the one registry of lever switches in this tree (``configs/*.env`` carry deployment parameters only).

A mode is a list of levers (``registry.LEVERS``) with its activation row — the environment the kits' worker runs under — and its
activation order; nothing here re-implements a lever (stack.py stages the kit files and launches the worker with the row; the levers
read their switches themselves).

    off    stock — no environment set, no lever applied (the stock CLI in a clean subprocess: stock_pred.py)
    exact  byte-identical to the stock as shipped (cuEquivariance kernels on, production defaults): the persistent worker under
           _EXACT_ROW, kernels on — every lever of the row is bitwise = stock (the engine adapters attach them: worker_launch --attach)
    fast   exact's composition plus the Tier-2 cells (_FAST_ROW), kernels on: numerics within the Tier-2 band vs the shipped stock
           (judged against the stock's own seed-to-seed band per target)
    big  the memory mode (Tier 2, composed on fast): fast's trunk and pair-track levers with the providers' ``big`` tier words, no
           CUDA graphs (the sampler roll-out, the DiT hoist and the trunk graphs leave the row by name), the memory line (boltz2_opt.big
           over opt_core.mem: _XL_ROW) and the allocator's expandable segments; lower peak GPU memory than the stock's, slower than fast

Ablation is row-level: a row's ``off`` entries take levers off BY NAME (``resolve``: ``take_off``) — ``off=<lever>:<reason>`` on the
ACTIVE line, ``LEVER name=<lever> state=off reason=<reason>``; no environment word, no flag.
Routes: the kits' line is the persistent worker (``PINNED_ROUTE``); ``enable()`` in a stock-CLI process and the ``BOLTZ2_OPT`` env route
refuse ``exact`` / ``fast`` by name (``CLI_ROUTE``: this tree carries no hook that chains the levers in one ``boltz predict`` process).
One activation row for every GPU key. The user-facing modes are exactly ``MODE_NAMES``; any other name is refused by name.
