"""``pred --mode exact|fast``: the kits' persistent worker on the caller's YAMLs — the kit route.

One process per call: the mode's kit files are staged (stack.stage), the worker variant is derived by the sampler add-on's own script, the
batch json is written from the YAMLs (one record per YAML; the record id is the YAML stem, which is the name stock gives the output
directory, bz_worker_lev.py:281-282), and the kit worker runs under the mode's activation row with the kits' probe arm's arguments
(modes.WORKER_ARGS). Outputs land where the worker puts them — ``<out_dir>/by_seed/<name>/s<seed>/`` with stock's file set
(``<name>_model_0.cif``, ``pae_<name>_model_0.npz``, ``plddt_<name>_model_0.npz``, ``confidence_<name>_model_0.json``) — plus the
worker's transcript ``<tag>_worker.log``; the launch's kit directory ``<out_dir>/_kit/`` holds the staged worker and the batch json (the
worker's own records — its log json, the KERNELS record, the affinity leg's hand-over — are written there and removed once folded into the
lines, remove_launch_records). The prediction settings are the call's — `boltz predict`'s own options (recycling_steps, sampling_steps,
diffusion_samples, max_parallel_samples, step_scale, write_full_pae, write_full_pde, output_format), upstream's defaults for the ones not given
(settings.worker_settings; the batch json), kernels per the mode row; ``pred --mode off`` with the same options is the stock arm of the same shape.

The worker's own log is the evidence that the row was in force (stack.evidence): missing evidence, a kit "not applied" line or a worker
exit code other than 0 is a failure of the run, never a silent stock result. Every expected (input, seed) unit is accounted (skipped.units):
ok, or failed with a named reason — an input the stock parser skipped is named by the worker's ``[boltz2-opt] SKIPPED item=<name>
reason=…`` line (relayed here), an (input, seed) unit boltz's own predict_step skipped on CUDA out of memory by the worker's ``failed``
entry (``FAILED item=<name> seed=<s> reason=upstream skipped batch: CUDA out of memory (…)``; boltz's ``| WARNING: ran out of memory,
skipping batch`` line relayed) — recorded under ``outputs.failed_units`` and counted failed; the exit is then 1 (outputs short). An input
declaring upstream's affinity property gets upstream's affinity leg after its structure pass (the worker's run_affinity_leg → affinity_leg.py,
stock's second model verbatim in a clean interpreter); its unit is complete only with ``affinity_<name>.json`` (expected_files).
